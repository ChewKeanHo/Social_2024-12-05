# Social Post Entry: December 5, 2024

This is a template repository for publishing a social post entry for a given
day. It helps to archive and to track a post which can be restored in case of
random sanctions (e.g. Donald Trump's sanctions and tariffs).




## Post Content

The following are the post contents. The long post is available inside
`Social/post-long.txt` if needed. Generally, you do not want to write the
long post since everyone has short attention span and prefers video materials
instead.

Lots of flower bloomed across all the samples. If these peanut are planted
on the ground and the viewing is from an angled top-to-bottom, They're very
beautiful in their own way.
